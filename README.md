## Make your own wikipedia.
For make your own wikipedia, Wikipedia module must be installed first.
- Download the latest [Python installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your OS.
I used [this website](https://www.alphr.com/pip-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/#:~:text=Reinstall%20Python%20to%20Fix%20'Pip,components%20to%20fix%20the%20problem.) for help, you can have a look if you want.
-  Users who want to use pip for installing the Wikipedia module on Windows in the command prompt have to use the command:
```
pip install wikipedia
```
Whatever you want to search for, go to ' search here '. And press ' search '.
The results are brought to the field below.
